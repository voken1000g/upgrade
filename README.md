## History Review

We went a long way in selecting community and formulating sales plans
because we lack an understanding of mainland China.
This brought the previous private placement to a halt at less than 7% progress.
The entry of unauthorized exchanges also disrupted the plan.

Many unqualified investors and speculators bought and held early tokens.
That is not the foundation on which a healthy and prosperous ecosystem can be built.

Even so, with the lack of development funds,
we had still made important achievements over the past year.

As you know, some services are already in beta. Such as:

- [Web-UI HD Wallet Toolkit][Web-UI HD Wallet Toolkit]
- Account Network
- App Network/Containers:
	- Proxy
- Client Network
	- Proxy ClientBase for Windows

It is important to understand
those achievements in communication protocols
are usually not perceived by the general user:


#### Some important achievements

- Optimized 3-layers network
- Higher performance hashing algorithms (multi-threaded)
- A better trading template system than smart contract
- More flexible scalability
- Quality of service is not limited by the only bus
- Encrypted communication protocol without handshake
- Featureless network communication packets (includes user authentication),
  cannot recognized by DPI


#### Most important things for a project

We believe that creating value is paramount to a project.

It's great that more and more people are holding the same view.

As we thought about the strategy, we received some suggestions that made sense.

By combining these,
we have made some important adjustments
and formed an optimized Tokenomics model,
which can lead to better prospects:


#### Optimized Tokenomics

**Main Differences**

## Resale or Upgrade program

Already deployed:

- [VokenTB Main Contract][VokenTB Main Contract]
- [VokenTB Early-Bird Sale Contract][VokenTB Early-Bird Sale Contract]

For those users who are holding Voken or Voken2.0,
there are two options to choose from:

1. **Resale**, get your investment back, paid in USD(DAI stablecoin).
2. **Upgrade**, migrate to the new VokenTB.

We know that some users bought tokens
without knowing anything about the project,
and some were lost confidence in the turmoil.

If you are one of these,
you can choose to resell by visit the dedicated dApp - [Resale or Upgrade Program][dApp].
Through resale,
you can get back more than your investment in DAI stablecoin.

Or, if you choose to upgrade,
you can use the same link before.
By upgrading,
you can get more than the value of your investment in VokenTB.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Why DAI stablecoin

We always believe that the degree of decentralization is very important.
And DAI is fully decentralized, which is developed by [MakerDAO][MakerDAO]

Meanwhile, it is well known that DAI is the most valuable of all stablecoins.

#### What should I do if I've sent my VOKEN(1.0/2.0) to an exchange?<br>What should I do if I bought VOKEN(1.0/2.0), but have not withdrown?

VOKEN(1.0/2.0) held by exchange wallets can only be applied for resale.

If you've sent your VOKEN to an exchange (or bought without withdrown).

You can contact Exchange Customer Service for assistance (get USD Token paid in DAI).

Here is a list of the exchange wallet addresses and names that we can confirm so far:
